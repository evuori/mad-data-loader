## 1. Executive Summary

The Advanced Order Management feature will enhance GlobalTech's e-commerce platform by introducing AI-driven purchasing workflows, bulk order capabilities, subscription-based ordering, and advanced order tracking. This feature will address critical pain points identified through customer feedback, including complex order processes for B2B customers, limited visibility into order status, and lack of flexibility for recurring orders. Implementation of this feature is expected to increase average order value by 15%, reduce order abandonment by 30%, and improve customer satisfaction scores by 20%.

## 2. Feature Overview

### 2.1 Feature Background

GlobalTech's e-commerce platform currently supports basic ordering capabilities, allowing customers to place individual orders for products. Customer feedback and market analysis have identified several limitations in the current ordering system:

- B2B customers struggle with placing large orders for multiple products
- Customers have limited visibility into order status and delivery timelines
- Recurring orders require manual reentry each time
- Order history and reordering capabilities are basic and cumbersome
- Competitive platforms offer more advanced ordering features

Sales data indicates that 65% of our B2B customers place orders across multiple product categories at least twice monthly, yet our current system doesn't facilitate efficient bulk ordering. Additionally, 40% of our retail customers purchase the same items on a predictable schedule but must manually reorder each time.

### 2.2 Feature Objectives

#### Primary Objectives:
- Implement bulk order capabilities with CSV upload and template-based ordering
- Create subscription-based ordering with customizable frequency and automatic processing
- Develop an enhanced order tracking system with real-time updates and predictive delivery estimates
- Implement one-click reordering from order history

#### Secondary Objectives:
- Integrate AI-powered product recommendations during the ordering process
- Add order splitting capabilities for different shipping addresses or delivery timelines
- Implement order approval workflows for B2B customers with multiple authorized purchasers
- Provide enhanced order analytics for customer order history

#### Key Success Factors:
- Increase average order value by 15%
- Reduce order abandonment rate from 25% to 17.5%
- Improve customer satisfaction scores related to ordering from 3.7/5 to 4.4/5
- Increase percentage of recurring orders from 22% to 40% of total orders

### 2.3 Feature Scope

#### 2.3.1 In Scope
- Bulk order interface with spreadsheet upload functionality
- Order templates for frequently purchased combinations
- Subscription order management (creation, modification, pause, cancellation)
- Enhanced order tracking with real-time updates
- One-click reordering from order history
- Order approval workflows for organizations
- Order splitting across multiple addresses
- Enhanced order history and analytics

#### 2.3.2 Out of Scope
- Changes to the underlying product catalog
- Modifications to the payment processing system
- Warehouse and inventory management integration
- Shipping carrier selection algorithms
- Customer account management
- Mobile app integration (will be addressed in a separate project)

## 3. Business Requirements

### 3.1 Business Process Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Current Business Process
Currently, customers place orders through a sequential process that requires selecting individual products, adding each to cart, and proceeding through a multi-step checkout:

1. Customer searches for or browses to individual products
2. Customer adds each product to cart individually
3. Customer reviews cart and proceeds to checkout
4. Customer completes shipping information
5. Customer selects payment method
6. Customer reviews and confirms order
7. Customer receives order confirmation via email
8. Customer checks order status by logging in and navigating to order history

For B2B customers with large orders, this process is repeated multiple times or requires customer service assistance. For recurring orders, customers must remember to reorder at appropriate intervals and manually re-enter the entire order.

Order tracking currently provides basic status updates (Order Placed, Processing, Shipped, Delivered) with limited detail and no real-time information.

#### 3.1.2 Proposed Business Process
The enhanced ordering system will support multiple ordering workflows:

**Standard Ordering (Existing Flow with Enhancements):**
- AI-powered recommendations displayed during product browsing and cart review
- One-page checkout option for returning customers
- Enhanced order confirmation with detailed tracking information

**Bulk Ordering:**
1. Customer selects "Bulk Order" option
2. Customer uploads CSV file with product SKUs and quantities or uses web form
3. System validates all products and quantities
4. Customer reviews consolidated order and makes adjustments
5. Customer completes checkout with shipping and payment details
6. Order is processed as single transaction but can be split for fulfillment

**Subscription Ordering:**
1. Customer selects "Subscribe" option for individual products or entire cart
2. Customer configures frequency, duration, and delivery preferences
3. System processes initial order
4. Subsequent orders are generated automatically according to schedule
5. Customer receives notifications before processing with option to modify
6. Customer can manage all subscriptions from central dashboard

**Order Tracking:**
1. Customer receives order confirmation with tracking link
2. Tracking page shows real-time status with visual workflow
3. System provides estimated delivery date based on historic data
4. Customer receives proactive notifications for status changes or delays
5. For complex orders, individual components can be tracked separately

**B2B Order Approval:**
1. Purchaser creates order and submits for approval
2. Authorized approvers receive notification
3. Approvers can review and approve/reject order
4. Upon final approval, order is automatically processed
5. All actions are logged for audit purposes

#### 3.1.3 Process Gap Analysis
Key gaps in the current process:

- Manual, repetitive entry for customers with regular purchasing patterns
- Inefficient process for large multi-item orders
- Limited visibility into order status
- No mechanisms for multi-person approval workflows in B2B scenarios
- Inability to create templates for frequently ordered combinations
- No system-driven reordering capabilities
- Limited personalization in the ordering process

The proposed processes address these gaps by automating repetitive tasks, providing multiple ordering workflows tailored to different customer needs, enhancing visibility, and adding flexibility to the ordering system.

Expected revenue impact: +18% in first year

### 5.2 Option 2: Phased Implementation

#### 5.2.1 Description
Implement the feature in three phases:
- Phase 1: Bulk ordering and order templates
- Phase 2: Subscription ordering and management
- Phase 3: Enhanced tracking, B2B approvals, and AI recommendations

#### 5.2.2 Pros and Cons
- Pros:
  - Earlier delivery of high-priority features
  - Reduced risk through incremental deployment
  - Opportunity to gather feedback between phases

### 5.4 Recommended Option

The recommended approach is Option 2: Phased Implementation. This option balances the need for timely delivery of high-priority features with risk management and quality assurance. Beginning with bulk ordering capabilities will address immediate B2B customer pain points, followed by subscription management to enhance retention, and finally the more complex features that require deeper integration.

The phased approach allows for customer feedback to inform subsequent phases and provides early business benefits while managing the complexity of the implementation. The slightly longer timeline and higher development effort are justified by the reduced risk profile and the ability to make adjustments based on real-world usage.
