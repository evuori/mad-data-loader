## 1. Executive Summary

Atlas Corporation requires a comprehensive Human Resources Management System (HRMS) to replace multiple disconnected legacy systems and manual processes. The TalentHub HRMS will consolidate employee data management, recruitment, onboarding, performance management, time tracking, learning and development, and benefits administration into a single integrated platform. This system will enhance operational efficiency, ensure regulatory compliance, improve data accuracy, and support strategic workforce planning while reducing administrative overhead by an estimated 40%.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Background

Atlas Corporation, a global manufacturing company with 5,000 employees across 12 countries, currently manages HR processes through a combination of:
- A 15-year-old employee database system with limited functionality
- Spreadsheet-based time tracking
- Paper-based performance review processes
- Manual recruitment tracking
- Third-party learning management system with limited integration
- Email-based leave requests and approvals
- Manual benefits enrollment and administration

This fragmented approach has resulted in:
- Data inconsistencies and duplication
- Excessive manual data entry (estimated 120 hours per week across the HR department)
- Limited reporting capabilities
- Compliance risks in multiple jurisdictions
- Inefficient onboarding (average 12 days to full productivity)
- Poor employee experience
- Limited visibility into talent metrics
- Difficulties in workforce planning

Recent company growth (35% increase in headcount over 3 years) has exacerbated these challenges, and the HR department struggles to scale operations efficiently while maintaining compliance with evolving regulations across multiple countries.

### 2.2 Project Objectives

#### Primary Objectives:
- Consolidate all HR functions into a single integrated system
- Automate routine HR processes and workflows
- Improve data accuracy and accessibility
- Enhance compliance with labor regulations across all operating countries
- Streamline recruitment and onboarding processes
- Provide self-service capabilities for employees and managers
- Deliver actionable analytics for strategic workforce planning

#### Secondary Objectives:
- Improve employee experience with HR processes
- Reduce time spent on administrative tasks
- Support remote and hybrid work models
- Enable mobile access to key HR functions
- Facilitate better performance management and employee development
- Reduce paper usage in HR processes

#### Key Success Factors:
- Reduce HR administrative time by 40%
- Decrease onboarding time to full productivity from 12 to 5 days
- Achieve 95% data accuracy across all HR records
- Reduce compliance-related incidents by 90%
- Achieve 85% or higher user satisfaction rating
- Reduce recruitment cycle time by 30%
- 100% on-time completion of required compliance reporting

## 3. Business Requirements

### 3.1 Business Process Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Current Business Process
**Employee Data Management:**
HR maintains employee records in a legacy database with limited functionality. Changes require manual entry and often duplication across multiple systems. Document management is largely paper-based with decentralized storage.

**Recruitment:**
Requisitions are created in Word documents and routed via email for approval. Applications are received via email and tracked in spreadsheets. Interview scheduling is managed through calendar invites and email. Candidate progress is updated manually.

**Onboarding:**
HR generates a checklist in Word for each new hire. Task completion is tracked manually. New employees complete paper forms on day one. IT, facilities, and other departments are notified via email for provisioning. Training is scheduled manually.

**Time and Attendance:**
Employees record time in department-specific spreadsheets. Leave requests are submitted via email. Managers approve manually and forward to HR. Attendance reports are compiled monthly from various sources.

**Performance Management:**
Annual reviews are conducted using Word templates. Goals are documented but not systematically tracked. Review forms are printed, signed, scanned, and stored in network folders. Limited visibility into progress throughout the year.

**Learning and Development:**
Third-party LMS has limited integration with other systems. Training records are maintained separately. Skills database is maintained in spreadsheets with infrequent updates.

**Benefits Administration:**
Annual enrollment involves paper forms. Changes due to life events require multiple forms and manual processing. Benefits queries handled individually by HR staff.
